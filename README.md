### Sound
Sound currently only works on linux. Windows just needs to link the SDL/SDL-Mixer libs properly (no big deal). to get the sound clone the sound branch.</br>

here is a list of package you'll need to install to get this up and running:</br>

open the terminal and type the following: </br>

on **ubuntu**: 
`sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev build-essential libassimp-dev qtcreator glew-utils libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev qt5-default` </br>
on **fedora**: 
`sudo yum install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel mesa-libGLU-devel glew-devel derelict-GLFW3-devel assimp-devel libX11-devel qt-creator qt5-qtbase SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2-devel`</br>
on **Windows**:
I honestly don't know just make sure your opengl drivers work and install glew, glfw3. </br>
